# doubleclickjacking

**Proof of concept to test successful redirection from an attacker-controlled UI**

---

## Vulnerability Overview

DoubleClickjacking is a novel exploitation technique that leverages subtle UI manipulation to bypass traditional clickjacking protections. This attack method involves a crafted user interface (UI), such as a cookie consent pop-up, designed to trick users into performing critical actions through a double-click sequence.

### Attack Flow

1. **Attacker-Controlled UI**: The attacker deploys a malicious interface (e.g., a cookie pop-up).
2. **Double-Click Interaction**: The user is prompted to double-click on an innocuous-looking button (e.g., "Accept Cookies").
3. **Redirection or Action**: The double-click triggers a hidden action, such as OAuth approval or sensitive workflow initiation, without the userâ€™s explicit consent.
4. **Impact**: Users unknowingly authorise actions, leading to account compromise, unauthorised access, or data leakage.

This proof of concept demonstrates how DoubleClickjacking could be used to manipulate user interactions while bypassing X-Frame-Options, Content Security Policies (CSP), and SameSite cookies.
